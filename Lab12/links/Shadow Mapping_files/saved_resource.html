And changing the projection so that it flips it gives us the correct result?\nI understand that openGL sees the bottom left as (0,0) of a texture and textures we load in are generally (0,0) at the top left, but im not sure what its doing when we are rendering to a texture using a framebuffer.\nThoughts?","canVote":false,"thread":"3672801901","forum":"learnopengl","depth":2,"points":0,"isEdited":false},{"dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"\u003cp>My guess is that in your original scene you have the culling order (or winding order of the vertices) reversed, in which case you cull the back-faces of all triangles which still results in the obvious edge you see there.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Then my guess is that due to the inversion of the y-axis in the projection matrix, you also inverse the winding order of the vertices rendered, in which case you accidentily fixed the proper faces to cull.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Instead of changing the orthographic projection, try changing the faces to cull (or check that the front faces are properly culled by culling them in your normal scene (with lights and perspective projection)).\u003c/p>\u003cp>You can do this by either setting the faces to cull to \u003ccode>GL_BACK\u003c/code> or changing the 'to-cull-winding-order'  of the vertices as follows:\u003c/p>\u003cpre>\u003ccode>glCullFace(GL_BACK);

<p>Very nice tutorials!  I am wondering if you have any experience with using a "uniform sampler2DShadow" to generate shadows?  The following tutorial uses them (if you actually download the code available).  I have implemented your method, but am wondering if there are any advantages/disadvantages to using this approach:</p><p><a href="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/intermediate-tutorials/tutorial-16-shadow-mapping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.opengl-tutorial.org...</a></p><p>In addition if I reduce the depth framebuffer's dimension to 256 from 1024, I end up with what appears to be "shadow acne" depending on the positioning of the light that is contained in a circle being cast on the ground.  In other words it doesn't affect the entire scene.  Does this ring a bell off the top of you head?  I can post more details as necessary.</p>

<p>In regards to <code>sampler2DShadow</code>: yes you can also assign the depth map to that sampler type and when you sample the texture it will also automatically do the depth comparrison for you (and thus return whether the sample is in shadow or not). <br>However, I'm a fan of understanding all my code and using semi-magic stuff like that while it isn't really necessary doesn't float my boat :p Perhaps the compilers can do some extra optimizations when it's enabled, but you'll have to be the judge of that (and test it of course ;)), but I doubt it matters.</p>

<p>Sensei,</p><p>I just made the (obvious) realization that the shadows will "bleed" through different layers of objects.  Imagine an object casting a shadow onto a thin object that has yet another object behind (or below) it.  Shadow casting will draw the shadow on every surface.  Is there anything that can be done about this?</p>

<p>Shadow mapping often requires a lot of tweaking to get it just right at which I listed most 'tricks' to sort of mitigate most problems in the tutorial. Keep in mind that shadow mapping has a finite precision so when you're working with really small gaps and/or objects you'll have to take this into account.</p>

<p>Imagine scaffolding that an object is sitting on with a light casting a <br>shadow straight down through different levels in the scaffolding.  Each <br>level will display the shadow it seems to me.  Is there a way to deal <br>with this that you can think of?  In other words the camera view <br>ultimately is a side shot that shows something standing on one level, <br>but the light source from above creates a shadow in all deeper levels.  <br>Am I missing something or is this expected behavior?</p><p>Solution:  This is expected, but now I am drawing the entire scene so shadows are being generated for the scaffolding as well, which then mask the shadow of the object sitting on the scaffolding itself.  Nothing surprising here :P</p>

</code></pre><p>my code here the function <code>SetDirLight(shader, lightDir, ambient, diffuse, specular) </code>,then set the <strong>lightDir</strong> to <strong>vec3(1.0f,-1.0f,0.0f)</strong>, and you can get the same result in this tutorial :)</p>

<p>Where do you get a <code>const lightDir</code> from? In this code we only specify a light position to the shaders using a uniform variable?</p><p>I think I understand what you mean though. When we are using a directional light source, we (in theory) don't have a light position but only a light direction so the most clean approach would be to pass only a light direction to the shader (doesn't have to be constant, and a uniform would be better).  <br>However, seeing as we sort of have a light position for calculating the shadow map, we simply used that position to dynamically calculate the light direction. It might not be the most clean directional light approach, but it works nonetheless. You be the judge of whatever approach you prefer :)</p>

<p>Thx for reply! my English is so poor, maybe mislead you on my word :(<br>I'm just confused on that a bit because I still use your nice code from the basic lighting tutorial and want to make a connect. Thus, CalcDirLight in shader give me a little confuse :P But whatever, you are right :D</p>

<p>Ahh that makes sense :) <br>I try to keep my tutorials self-contained, which basically means that you don't need (too much) previous experience or other tutorials in order to understand this tutorial. I want anyone to follow this tutorial, including people that didn't follow the basic lighting tutorials (people that, for example, simply look for a shadow mapping tutorial and this is the first one that pops up on Google). <br>That's why I didn't use the same light/material stuff I introduced in those tutorials ;)</p>

<p>Fantastic tutorial once again.<br>I seem to have encountered an issue though. In the section relating to 'peter panning' you suggest culling the front faces of the objects when rendering to the depth map. When I do this I get the results in the picture. The cube(s) on the ground have a non shadowed area on the part of the floor very close to the cube which should be shadowed. I tried using your source code too and got the same results. Thoughts?</p>

<p>Yeah, this happens because of shadow map precision issues and shadow bias that offsets the shadow a little and this is especially noticeable when a cube is on the floor. Because the cube touching the floor, its back-faces depth map values should directly correspond to the floor's shadow values, but as you can see that isn't always the case. <br>As with most of shadow mapping it's usually tiny little hacks that don't necessarily work on all objects; in this case it's best not to do face culling when a cube directly touches the ground (or find some other clever trick I can't think of at the top of my head ;) )</p>

<p>Hey Joey,</p><p>This kept bugging me so i had another few goes trying to fix it.<br> I scoured the internet without much luck. Every tutorial i looked at kept saying the best way to solve this issue was to cull front faces when rendering the shadow map, yours included. The thing was, when i culled front faces when rendering the shadow map it created the issue that it was supposed to solve! If I culled back faces instead I didn't have the issue.</p><p>I ran some other demo's and they worked as they should so I can confirm its not a weird hardware related problem or anything.</p><p>So i kept poking around. Eventually I came across this. If I change<br>glm::ortho(-10.0f, 10.0f, -10.0f, 10.0f, near_plane, far_plane);<br>to <br>glm::ortho(-10.0f, 10.0f, 10.0f, -10.0f, near_plane, far_plane);,</p><p>it works correctly. It seems this change flips the shadowmap (?)<br>In the image below it shows the demo scene with front faces culled when rendering the shadow map and the 2 different projections applied. As you can see when changing the bottom and top ortho values around we get the correct result.</p><p>Ive been trying to wrap my head around why this would happen. Is it possible the shadowmap is being stored upside down? And changing the projection so that it flips it gives us the correct result?<br>I understand that openGL sees the bottom left as (0,0) of a texture and textures we load in are generally (0,0) at the top left, but im not sure what its doing when we are rendering to a texture using a framebuffer.<br>Thoughts?</p>

<p>My guess is that in your original scene you have the culling order (or winding order of the vertices) reversed, in which case you cull the back-faces of all triangles which still results in the obvious edge you see there.</p><p>Then my guess is that due to the inversion of the y-axis in the projection matrix, you also inverse the winding order of the vertices rendered, in which case you accidentily fixed the proper faces to cull.</p><p>Instead of changing the orthographic projection, try changing the faces to cull (or check that the front faces are properly culled by culling them in your normal scene (with lights and perspective projection)).</p><p>You can do this by either setting the faces to cull to <code>GL_BACK</code> or changing the 'to-cull-winding-order'  of the vertices as follows:</p><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="identifier">glCullFace</span>(<span class="constant">GL_BACK</span>);

<p>Hey Joey!</p><p>At least in my program if I cull the back-faces it cause the Peter Panning and if I cull the front-faces it results in a non-shadowed area very close to the cube.</p><p>Besides, why would the cube's back-faces depth map values correspond to the floor's shadow values if I already cull the front-faces?</p>

<p>Yes, it makes things slightly more softer, but the blocky pattern is still there. An improvement is to implement your own linear texture filtering (as OpenGL does it for normal textures) but use it do sample the shadow map multiple times and interpolate the sub-results bi-linearly. It still isn't perfect, but combining this with PCF gives better results than without the bi-linear interpolation, so yeah it does make a difference :)</p><p>This video at around 17:00 does exactly that:</p><p> <span></span><div class="media-container media-mode-deferred">

<p>You'd need PCF to blur the shadow maps (I've showed a very basic PCF example in this tutorial); there are much better ways to do PCF of which you can find plenty when you google around.</p><p>If you want a much better (and cheaper) blur I'd suggest you look into variance shadow mapping which is a great technique and largely similar to shadow mapping for high quality looking shadows where you can use the hardware's filtering solutions (like linear texture sampling) and use blurs like a gaussian blur onto the shadow map. Take a look at BennyBox's youtube tutorials about variance shadow mapping if you want to know more. The technique has a few caveats in where it won't always work (specifically with light bleeding), but so does shadow mapping :)</p>

<p>I'm having some major issues trying to implement this with deferred rendering. Anyone managed to do it? I render the depth map which looks fine (it is red and black instead of black and white for some reason, but somebody told me this is okay apparently) and I send it to my lightpass along with a buffer containing the fragment positions in lightspace. Then I do the calculation exactly like in the tutorial and it completely flips out. I've made sure that both the depth buffer and the fragment positions in lightspace arrive to the lightpass as well.</p>

<p>Hi everybody, I have an harsh problem with spotlight shadows. When my spotlight is a little too far from my object, there is no more shadows. <br>It appears that it is due to the projection matrix built like this perspective(spotlight.halfAngle*2, 1, 0.1, spotMaxRange);<br>If I draw two objects one behind another and I inspect shadowMap values through a debug software, it appears that difference between the top object's depth is really close to the object's depth behind him (the difference is about 1.10-4).<br>And I can't solve it with bias because the bias would solve it for limited distance and not if my spot is really far from objects  (moreover with spot and objects aligned on z axis, the bias doesn't change withspotlight distance).<br>Does somebody could help me ?</p>
